            # Our Mission
        Our goal is to help students along their academic journey and expand the scope of education through using Artificial Intelligence and experienced counselors. 

        ## Heather Valentine, College Prep Head Counselor
        "As the Head Counselor of a college preparatory, private high school, I can tell you how important it is for students to get robust and individualized academic counseling to help them along the pathway to college. Each student is uniquely individual and it's very important to find the right balance of courses and activities so students are challenged, but not to the point where they are overwhelmed or have too much on their plate.  Anoushka's academic counseling app would be a great resource to address the disparity of access to academic counseling that the majority of students do not have.  Many underserved students do not have access to the same resources as others and this app would be a great help in linking them to guidance as well as providing the volunteers with meaningful work and connection to others.  This app addresses a clear need that exists in current society and would be a great asset to many students and help open up doors in the future."
